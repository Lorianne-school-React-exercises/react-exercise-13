# ðŸ’ª Challenge: Displaying a quote from The Simpsons

- You're going to build an application to retrieve a random quote from The Simpsons series.
- Use the The Simpsons Quote API that we've setup. You'll have to initialise the state of your application with an initial quote, obtained from this API.
- The application should include: A button to retrieve a quote, an area where the name of the character, the photo and the quote is displayed (it is possible to reuse code from previous quests, namely the QuoteCard component)
- Be sure to pay attention to the structure of the received data: do you receive an array? An object? The data.results[0] code we used with the Random User API is not relevant here, because the structure of the data provided by the API is different!
- Commit and push your code to GitHub, then import that repository into CodeSandbox. As a reminder: Create Sandbox > "Import Project" button > paste repository URL > Save (File > Save menu).

#### Result:
